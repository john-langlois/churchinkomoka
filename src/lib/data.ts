    title: "Bible",
    content: "We believe that the Holy Scriptures (Bible) is inspired by God and that it is without error in the original manuscripts. We believe that the Holy Bible is the authoritative written Word of God and that it stands alone as the vehicle for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness. Furthermore, we believe that the scriptures are to be interpreted in a contextual and literal way and that they are to be understood and applied personally as the believer is guided by the Spirit of God. (1 Corinthians 2:13, 2 Timothy 3:16 17; I Thessalonians 2:13; II Peter 1:21)"

    title: "God",
    content: "The Godhead exists eternally in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19,20; John 1:1-3; 8:58; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 4:6; Hebrews 9:14)."
  },
  {
    title: "Jesus Christ",
    content: "We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man; born of a virgin and the only person to live a sinless life. Because of Christ's sacrifice, He is the substitute for the sinner and the one mediator who can affect the reconciliation between a Holy God in heaven and a sinful person on earth. He was buried and rose bodily from the dead and ascended to His Father's right hand, where He now ministers there as intercessor and advocate for us before the Father. Jesus Christ, as He did on earth, continues to serve us as our Lord, praying for us and defending us. (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:35; Luke 24:39; John 1:1-3,14,17,18; John 5:18; John 15:12 15; Acts 2:31 32; Philippians 2:6-11; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 2 Corinthians 5:18 19; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 1:19; 2:9;1 Timothy 2:5 6; Hebrews 1:1-9; 4:14 16; 9:24; 1 Peter 2:22,24, 3:18; 1 John 2: 1 2; 1 John 5:20; Revelation 1:8)"
  },
  {
    title: "Holy Spirit",
    content: "The Holy Spirit is one of the Persons of the Godhead, who convicts man of sin, righteousness and judgement, and regenerates, indwells, baptizes and seals all believers in Christ and fills those yielded to God. At the moment of salvation, the Holy Spirit baptizes the believer into the 'family' of God or 'body' of Christ permanently and fully indwelling each Christian. The Holy Spirit's indwelling sets us apart for spiritual service and gives His gifts and power to help us live a godly life as evidenced by the fruit of the Spirit in our lives. (Matthew 28:19; John 3:3-7; Acts 1:8; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:12; 6:19; 12:13; 1 Corinthians 6:19 20; Ephesians 1:13 14, 4:30; 2:22; 4:30; Galatians 5:16, 22 23)."
  },
  {
    title: "Man",
    content: "Man was created in the image and likeness of God, but in/through Adam, all mankind fell into sin with the result that all men are sinners, hopelessly sinful in themselves, apart from the grace of God (Genesis 1:27; 9:6; Romans 3:23; 5:12; 8:6,7)."
  },
  {
    title: "Sin",
    content: "We believe that Jesus did not come to abolish the law but raise the standard. Sin is not only a matter of action but a problem of the human heart without the redeeming sacrifice of Jesus there is no hope for a human. We believe that every man without exception is totally depraved and in need of the Saviour (Genesis 3:1-6; Romans 3:10-19; Romans 1:18, 32). Jesus wants man to repent, with broken hearts opened to Him. We believe that every person must be afforded compassion, love, kindness, respect, and dignity. Hateful and harassing behaviour or attitudes directed toward any individual are to be repudiated and are not in accord with scripture nor the doctrines of the church. (Mathew 5:17-48; Titus 3:1-5)"
  },
  {
    title: "Salvation",
    content: "The Greek word for Salvation is \"Sozo\" which applies not only to salvation but also to healing and deliverance. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ gave His life as a ransom for many and rose again from the dead on the third, He ascended into heaven, and He acts as our High Priest and Advocate according to the Scriptures. We believe that we are saved by grace through faith, so everyone that believes in the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, repents and is baptized in water for the remission of sins; receives the dwelling of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe believe that It is God's divine decision to save a person and it is God's kindness, forbearance, and patience that lead that person to repentance. The Bible also teaches that each person is responsible to embrace or reject the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord and that God welcomes all who come to Him by faith. Both truths—God's sovereignty in salvation and man's decision to embrace Christ—are taught in the Scriptures. Their co-existence is a mystery and is completely understood only through the mind of our omniscient God."

    title: "Sanctification",
    content: "Every born-again believer has a positional place in Christ and is promised progressive transformation through sanctification of becoming Christ-like. (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 5:26-27; 1 Thessalonians 4:3,4; 5:23; Hebrews 10:10,14; 1 John 3:2)."
  },
  {
    title: "The Church",
    content: "The Church is formed by disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. Disciples are those that believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, repented of their sin, were baptized in water for the remission of sins and received the dwelling of the Holy Spirit. The Church exists in two aspects, universal and local. The universal Church is an elect company of disciples baptized by the Holy Spirit into one body. Its mission is to witness to its Head, Jesus Christ, preaching the gospel among all nations. It will be caught up to meet the Lord at His return on the clouds and will reign with the Lord when He comes to establish His millennial kingdom on the earth. The local Church is a group of disciples joined together to worship God with praise and thanksgiving and to glorify Lord Jesus Christ through an aggressive effort to be disciples that make other disciples for our Lord Jesus Christ. The Church is the body and the bride of Christ. (Acts 2:42; 1 Corinthians 12:4-27; Ephesians 1:22,23; 5:24-30)."
  },
  {
    title: "Spiritual Gifts",
    content: "The Spiritual gifts are expressed in three ways:\n1. The gifts that God the Father gives to the members of the body of Christ. (Romans 12:3-8)\n2. The ministry gifts which are given by our Lord Jesus Christ to every disciple. (Ephesians 4:7-16)\n3. The manifestation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit through the disciples. (1 Corinthians 12:4-11)\n\nGod is sovereign in the bestowing of His gifts and when those gifts are expressed according to the scriptures the body Christ is edified. (1 Corinthians 14:23-40; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Hebrews 2:3-4)."
  },
  {
    title: "Divine Healing",
    content: "We believe the prophecy mentioned in Isaiah 53 explains God's plan to heal us first spiritually, then emotionally and physically. We also believe that God does heal today in answer to His sovereign grace and believing prayers. (1 Peter 2:24; James 5:14-15)."
  },
  {
    title: "Christian Life",
    content: "Christians are called to a holy life of testimony and service in the power of the Holy Spirit, which service includes the proclamation of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to the whole world. There are promised rewards in heaven for faithfulness in such service (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 3:12-17; 2 Corinthians 5:9-10; 1 Peter 1:15,16)."
  },
  {
    title: "Ordinances",
    content: "Baptism in water is for the remission of sins of the believers and their identification with the Lord Jesus Christ.\nThe Lord's Supper is for all disciples, done in remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ's death and a new covenant.\nA public dedication of the children of Christian parents, according to the dedication of Jesus as a child, is a testimony to the importance of biblical teachings. (Matthew 28:19-20; Luke 2:21-44; Acts 8:12-36-38; 9:18; 10:47; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26)"
  },
  {
    title: "Angels",
    content: "We believe that God created an innumerable company of spiritual beings, known as angels. We believe that the majority of angels kept their holy estate and are before the throne of God, worshipping the LORD, from where they are sent forth as ministering spirits to those who shall be heirs of salvation. We also believe that \"Lucifer, son of the morning\" was one of the angels—that sinned through pride, thereby becoming the enemy \"Satan\" and one-third of the angels followed him in his moral fall and became demons. Some of those demons are active as Satan's agents to execute his unholy purposes, while others are \"reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day\"."
  },
  {
    title: "Second Coming",
    content: "We believe that this present age will end with the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, first to receive His Church unto Himself and then to establish His throne upon the earth and to reign in righteousness over it for a thousand years. (2 Samuel 7:16; Psalm 72:7,8; Isaiah 9:6,7; Micah 5:2; Luke 1:32,33: John 14:1-3; Acts 1:10,11; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; Hebrews 9:28; Titus 2:13)."
  },
  {
    title: "Marriage and Family",
    content: "We believe that there is only one marriage and it was ordained by the LORD God at creation as the sacred union of one man and one woman. All sexual relations must therefore, be reserved for that union. Christian marriage is a representation of Christ's relationship to His church. We also believe that children are blessings from the Lord. Thus, all human life is sacred and worthy of protection from the moment of conception. (Genesis 1:26-28; 2:24; Psalms 127, 128; 139:13-16; Matthew 19:1-10; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Ephesians 5:22-33; Hebrews 13:4)"

    spotifyLink: "https://open.spotify.com",
    articleContent: {
      intro: "What does it truly mean to follow Jesus in the modern world? It starts with a radical denial of self.",
      paragraphs: [
        "In Mark 8:34, Jesus summons the crowd and issues a challenge that echoes through history: 'If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.' This is not a suggestion for spiritual improvement; it is a requirement for spiritual life.",
        "To deny oneself is to step off the throne of one's own life. It means that my desires, my plans, and my rights are secondary to the will of the Master. It is a daily decision to surrender control.",
        "Taking up the cross is not merely bearing a burden or a difficulty. In the Roman context, a man carrying a cross was a man on a one-way journey. He was not coming back. Similarly, our commitment to Christ is total and final."
      ],
      takeaways: [
        "Discipleship is an invitation to die to self and live to Christ.",
        "It involves active obedience, not passive belief.",
        "The reward of discipleship is Christ Himself."

      intro: "We are not isolated believers; we are stones being built into a spiritual house.",
      paragraphs: [
        "Peter describes believers as 'living stones' being built up as a spiritual house. This imagery is profound. A stone by itself is just a rock. But a stone that is shaped and fitted into a wall becomes part of something greater than itself.",
        "This is the picture of the church. We are jointed together. This means our sharp edges might rub against one another as we are fitted together, but this process is essential for the structural integrity of the House of God.",
        "Community is not optional for the Christian; it is our nature. We are saved into a family."
      ],
      takeaways: [

        "Without the resurrection, Paul says our faith is futile. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead. This historical fact changes everything about how we view death, suffering, and the future.",
        "The resurrection validates Jesus' claims to be the Son of God. It is the receipt that the payment for sin was accepted by the Father.",
        "For the believer, death is not the end but a doorway. We grieve, but not as those who have no hope."
      ],
      takeaways: [
